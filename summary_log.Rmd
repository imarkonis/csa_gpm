```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

Started with Attiki region (Greece) and 10-min automatic sensor data vs 30-min gpm data (December 2017). 
Big discrepancies in amounts - but the days of events are ok.

Comparison with daily knmi gpm data shows better agreement but still the differences persist.
Monthly averages are quite close (due to over-under-estimations). Heterogeneity of ground
observations are higher (range: 10 - 90mm for month) compared to satelltie (40 - 60mm).

Moving to Netherlands (experiment 3) things are quite better. There is some aggreement between station, 
radar and satellite data.
